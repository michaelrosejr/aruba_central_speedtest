# Aruba Central Speed Test

## Getting Started
To start, please login to Aruba Central and create an API System Token Under Maintenance -> API Gateway. Once done, download the token and save it as ``defualt.token.json`` in the directory where you installed this script.

You'll also need to create a ``config.yml`` file. There's a ``sample.config.yml`` that you should use as a template. You'll need the following info:

URL for access the Aruba Central API for your region
customer_id for identify who you are as a customer
client_id for identify your API ID
client_secret for accessing your API
